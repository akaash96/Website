		<h4>PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a line of eighth generation home video game consoles developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. 
		Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 during a press conference on February 20, 2013, it was launched
		on November 15 in North America, November 29 in Europe, South America and Australia; and February 22, 2014, in 
		Japan. It competes with Nintendo's Wii U and Switch, and Microsoft's Xbox One.
		
		<p>The PlayStation 4 uses an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) developed by AMD in cooperation 
		with Sony. It combines a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU), as 
		well as other components such as a memory controllerand video decoder. The CPU consists of 
		two quad-core Jaguar modules totaling 8 x86-64 cores. The GPU consists of 18 compute units to 
		produce a theoretical peak performance of 1.84 TFLOPS. The system's GDDR5 memory is 
		capable of running at a maximum clock frequency of 2.75 GHz (5500 MT/s) and has a maximum 
		memory bandwidth of 176 GB/s. The console contains 8 GB of GDDR5 memory, 16 times the 
		amount of RAM found in the PS3 and is expected to give the console considerable longevity. It 
		also includes secondary custom chips that handle tasks associated with downloading, uploading, 
		and social gameplay. These tasks can be handled seamlessly in the background during 
		gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode. The console also contains an audio module, 
		which can support in-game chat as well as "a very large number" of audio streams for use in-
		game. All PlayStation 4 models support high dynamic range (HDR) color profiles.</p>
